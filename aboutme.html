<h1>About Me</h1>
I am a seasoned software engineer with 25 years of experience in the industry.
<p />
For the past 13 years I have been working at
<a href="https://www.booking.com">booking.com</a>, now the leading
online travel agency in the world, but still a relatively small start-up when I
joined. I've seen it grow from a size of 20 developers to hundreds and then
thousands, matching its business expansion. I became familiar with the
challenges of explosive growth, and developed a keen interest for scalability
problems, from all points of view: technical, organisational, and process
governance.
<p />
I assumed a few different roles at booking.com, including management of small
agile teams, product manager in the core infrastructure department, and finally
individual contributor at the top of the ladder of technical leadership, as
principal developer and fellow. During that time my main areas of focus were
twofold:
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure scalability and reliability: I have led the creation of the
Site Reliability Engineering organisation, transforming the processes and
tooling to achieve excellent uptime of our main websites and services. I have
deep insights in what makes a software architecture resilient, what good
monitoring entails and how to organise incident response at scale.</li>
<li>Financial infrastructure: for the past two years I have been responsible
for the architecture and the implementation of a scalable and flexible payment
and financial platform, encompassing online payments, regulatory compliance,
accounting, and invoicing. In this last position I was part of our Payments
Business Unit, that comprises about 180 engineers, working in close relation to
the senior director of technology and the senior director of product. I have
acquired there a strong grasp of the challenges of the online payment space
worldwide.</li>
</ul>
Both positions required me to engage continuously with multiple stakeholders
across the company, be it in tech, product, information security, corporate
finance, or internal audit, while staying aware of all technological details in
order to connect engineering excellence and business focus.
<p />
I strongly believe that relentless customer focus informed by excellent data
gathering and efficient cross-functional communication is the key to successful
delivery for engineering teams.
<p />As a leader, my approach is to empower and trust my teams, preferring
independence informed by a solid common vision over micro-management. As a
strategic thinker, I am able to define the vision and devise a pragmatic way to
get there. I am hands-on when needed and I am never satisfied by a status quo
that creates problems or roadblocks. As an avid learner, I have the conviction
that insights can come from anywhere and from anybody, and I strive to create
an atmosphere where feedback and challenges are encouraged.
